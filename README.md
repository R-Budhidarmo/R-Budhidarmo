## About Me
#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!! I'm glad to have you here :sunny: :star2: :sparkles: :smiley:
</br> Not too long ago, after working in the pharmaceutical industry for a while :syringe: :pill: :factory: & after becoming a dad for the 1st time during lockdown :baby: :heart: :family: , I decided to take the plunge & finally learn how to code :computer:.
</br> I really wanted a change for the better :chart_with_upwards_trend: and learn something new :bar_chart: :books:. I guess you can say that I'm an aspiring Data Analyst / Data Scientist / Data Engineer. I'm at the beginning stage of this journey & actively developing my skillsets & portfolio (so far the repos are mainly from my coursework). In the near future, when I find cool stuff on the internet, I'll incorporate it into my repos & share it here, so hopefully, there's something for everyone to learn from or simply check out. Watch this space!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on levelling up in Python & SQL 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to scrape online data using various APIs & how to tidy up other people's messy Excel spreadsheets at work :chart_with_downwards_trend: :sweat_smile:
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything to do with data analytics, ML, data engineering & backend dev
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love music :musical_score::notes:. I play keys :musical_keyboard: & guitars :guitar: & I'm a big fan of power / prog / symphonic metal :metal: :violin:
